## Hello!

I am a research master's student at the Methodology & Statistics Department at Utrecht University. My interests are (intensive) longitudinal data, Bayesian statistics, model selection, and causal inference. In my free time I enjoy going to the gym or cycling. When I am less active, I like to play video games.
